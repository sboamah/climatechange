Hurricanes and Global Temperature Trends

### Idea
- amount of hurricanes recorded over time per year

### Hurricanes in the United States

This data set intrigues me because I want to see if there have been increased amounts of hurricanes over the years in the U.S. due to climate change. It feels like extreme weather has worsened in recent years, and specifically New Jersey has seen dangerous hurricanes in recent history. I am assuming that the data will show an increase in hurricanes over a 30-year span. If not, I'm hoping that there will be a trend in increased hurricanes that make landfall so it can correlate to increased severity. What I noticed from how the data is presented is that the III has links to the export their tables to an Excel spreadsheet, which makes parsing the data a lot easier. However, the data is shown in different time intervals with some overlaps, so I have to combine the spreadsheets to make a 30-year span.

This data set intrigues me because with broadening my scope to all Atlantic hurricanes, it feels like extreme weather has worsened in recent years, and I want to see if the data agrees to my sentiments. I am assuming that the data will show an increase in hurricanes over a 30-year span once I focus the data specifically on 1990-2020. If not, I'm hoping that there will be a trend in increased hurricanes that make landfall so it can correlate to increased severity. What I noticed from how the data is presented is that it was already parsed data on a webpage in a form of a HTML table. However, I was able to copy and paste it cleanly into a Google spreadsheet.

### Global Ocean & Land Temperature Anomalies

This data set intrigues me because hurricanes are caused by warm water and warm air. I wanted to see if the increase in ocean and land temperature would 
correlate to any increases in hurricanes, using the 30-year time frame. I broaden the data to global trends because the site had more data to show for global rather than by region. I am assuming that the change in temperature will have a positive correlation overall. I wanted to divide the land and ocean data to see how those trends look like separated rather than combined (like the default on the site). What I noticed about the data was that the site generated a table, Excel file, and a graph all for me and allowed me to parse the information I needed. I was definitely lucky to find this source because it made getting what I want to research easier.
